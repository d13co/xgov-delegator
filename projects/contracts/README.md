# xgov-delegator

Smart contract to delegate xGov voting power for pooled and liquid staking systems.

- xgov committees
  - needs data to be synced to contract:
    - committee ID
      - read this from proposals to know if delegated account has voting power
    - period start round (inclusive)
    - period end round (exclusive)
    - sync from xgov-committee-oracle
      - do we need to get xgov delegations from registry?

- external voting power
  - xgov votes delegated to this system on xGov registry. Delegators would usually be smart contract account(s) (e.g. reti pool, dualstake token, etc)
  - support multiple accounts. E.g. reti can have up to 4 pools, xALGO/tALGO have multiple participating contract escrows. Etc

- internal voting power
  - voting power split between accounts participating
  - metric: algohours
    - corresponds to 1 hour of 1 algo staked in the system
  - offchain/trusted component to generate algohours per committee period
  - stored per 1M rounds to reduce stored state

## State

### Global

- `last_account_id`: uint32 (0) - incrementing account ID counter
- `committeeOracleApp`: Application - Committee Oracle Application ID
- `voteSubmitThreshold`: uint64 (10800) - time in seconds before external vote end to submit votes (default: 3 hours)
- `absenteeMode`: string ('strict') - absentee mode: 'strict' or 'scaled'

### Account boxes (keyPrefix: 'A')

key: address

value: uint32 incrementing ID

Assigns uint32 ids to accounts to save 28 bytes per reference

### Algohour Period Totals (keyPrefix: 'H')

Total internal voting power per period fragment (1M rounds)

key: period_start (uint64, aligned to 1M)

value: AlgohourPeriodTotals struct
- `totalAlgohours`: uint64 - total algohours between [period_start, period_start+1M)
- `final`: boolean - indicates account algohour records are complete for this period

### Algohour per Account (keyPrefix: 'h')

Account internal voting power per 1M period fragment

key: [period_start (uint64), account_id (uint32)]

value: algohours (uint64)

### Committee Metadata (keyPrefix: 'C')

Synced committee details with own delegated totals

key: committee_id (byte[32])

value: DelegatorCommittee struct
- `periodStart`: uint32
- `periodEnd`: uint32
- `extDelegatedVotes`: uint32 - total voting power delegated by xGov. Can be split across multiple accounts
- `extDelegatedAccountVotes`: [accountId uint32, votes uint32][] - individual delegated xGov accounts & their voting power

### Proposal Metadata (keyPrefix: 'P')

key: proposal_id (Application)

value: DelegatorProposal struct
- `status`: string - 'WAIT' | 'VOTE' | 'VOTD' | 'CANC'
  - is VOTE needed or can it be removed? logically we would just go WAIT>VOTED
- `committeeId`: byte[32]
- `extVoteEndTime`: uint32
- `extTotalVotingPower`: uint32 (not dupe - committee member may have been removed for absenteeism)
- `extAccountsPendingVotes`: [accountId uint32, votes uint32][] - added when synced, removed when vote is cast
- `extAccountsVoted`: [accountId uint32, votes uint32][] - accounts that have voted
- `intVoteEndTime`: uint64 - set earlier than external to allow for vote submission before xGov proposal voting ends
- `intTotalAlgohours`: uint64 - sum of algohour period totals for committee periods
- `intVotedAlgohours`: uint64
- `intVotesYesAlgohours`: uint64
- `intVotesNoAlgohours`: uint64
- `intVotesBoycottAlgohours`: uint64

### Vote Receipts (not yet implemented)

key: [account id][proposal_id]

value: empty # if no changing vote allowed

value: [votes_yes,votes_no] # if changing vote is allowed

receipt to ensure each subdelegator votes once

changing votes could be allowed, subtract previous votes_yes / votes_no and add new ones

```
// get committee record for metadata
committee = self.committees[committee_id]
// account/xgov ingest progress uses superbox size
ingested_accounts = count from superbox
// get last ingested ID to ensure ascending ID order, deduplication enforcement
last_ingested_id = ingested_accounts > 0 ? [ingested_accounts - 1].id : 0
// ensure we are not going over by # of accounts
ensure(ingested_accounts + xGovs.length <= committee.total_members)
// buffer to write to superbox once
write_chunk: bytes of shape [id, votes][]
// iterate xGovs
foreach xGov in xGovs:
  // get or create account id
  account_id = getOrCreateAccountId(account)
  // assert ascending ID ingestion for dedupe/uniqueness enforcement
  assert account_id > last_ingested_id
  // keep track of ingested votes
  committee.ingested_votes += votes
  // assert not going over available votes
  assert committee.ingested_votes <= committee.total_votes
  // increase counter
  last_ingested_id = account_id
  write_chunk += [account_id, votes]
